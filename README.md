# Playing with Unison

from project root directory...
```bash
  ucm -c .
```

getting at the Unison UI is as simple as typing
```
ui
```
in the ucm terminal. That will take you to a locally hosted webpage - something like:
```
http://127.0.0.1:37397/_tYNA-EKZXmXy75H/ui
```

In order to use ucm via the VSCode Extension, give it that same url, but swap the `ui` at the end for `api`. So far, I'm not understanding the utility in the extension over and above the ui browser, but we'll see how it goes.
